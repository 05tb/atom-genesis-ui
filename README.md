# Genesis Atom UI

This is a UI theme to the <a href="https://atom.io/themes/genesis-syntax">Genesis Syntax Theme</a>. Its light, minimalistic design is meant to be a welcome contrast to the syntax theme. Future updates will include a focus setting that nearly hides the files in your tree that are not in use to minimize distractions.
